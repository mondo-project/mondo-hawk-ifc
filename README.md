IFC support for Hawk
===

This repository contains components to extend [Hawk](https://github.com/mondo-project/mondo-hawk-ifc) with support to parse IFC building information modelling models, and provides Thrift web services to export IFC models from remote Hawk indexes.

This implementation is based on the OpenBIM server libraries, [some of which](http://bimserver.org/license/) are under the Affero GPLv3 license which is incompatible with the main EPL2 license used with Hawk. Users wishing to use these components may want to adopt a distribution of Hawk under its secondary GPLv3 license.

For any queries, feel free to contact us through Twitter (@antoniogado / @kolovos), or file an issue.
